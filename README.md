# Ragdoll Module
A module that obviously makes ragdolls.

## Known Issues
Ragdolls don't work normally on all clients except of owned one.

## Building
To build the module from scratch, run:

<s>bash
rojo build -o Ragdoll.rbxm
Module will appear in the initial folder.
</s>

For some reason build makes an empty rbxm file.
Sync the source code with roblox place using:
```bash
rojo serve
```
It will make the module appear in *ReplicatedStorage/Shared*.
